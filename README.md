<h1>Student Performance Prediction System using Machine Learning and AWS Deployment</h1><br>
This project aims to develop a Student Performance Prediction System using machine learning techniques and deploying it on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system predicts students' academic performance based on various factors such as demographics, socio-economic status, past academic records, and extracurricular activities. It provides insights to educators, administrators, and policymakers to identify at-risk students early and implement targeted interventions for academic success.

<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
Predicting student performance is vital for educational institutions to provide personalized support and interventions, ultimately improving student outcomes. This project offers a predictive tool that utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast students' academic performance, aiding educators in identifying students who may require additional assistance or resources.<br>

<h2>Features</h2><br>
-Utilizes machine learning algorithms for student performance prediction.<br>
-Integrates various features such as demographic data, socio-economic status, past academic records, and extracurricular activities.<br>
-Provides accurate predictions of students' academic performance.<br>
-Scalable and deployable on AWS for wider accessibility.<br>
-Customizable and adaptable to different educational settings and student populations.<br>
<h2>Machine Learning Model</h2><br>
The system employs machine learning classification or regression algorithms trained on a dataset containing features relevant to student performance. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, where historical data with known outcomes (e.g., grades, graduation rates) are used to train the algorithm. Algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Gradient Boosting can be experimented with to determine the most accurate prediction model.<br>

<h2>Deployment on AWS</h2><br>
-Deployment on AWS ensures accessibility and scalability of the Student Performance Prediction System. The deployment process involves:<br>

-Setting up an AWS EC2 instance for hosting the application.<br>
-Configuring security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.<br>
-Installing necessary dependencies such as Python, Flask (or any other web framework), and required libraries.<br>
-Deploying the machine learning model along with the application code.<br>
-Configuring a domain name and SSL certificate for secure communication.<br>
<h2>Usage</h2><br>
-To use the Student Performance Prediction System:<br>

-Input relevant student data such as demographics, socio-economic status, past academic records, and extracurricular activities into the provided interface.<br>
-Submit the data for prediction.<br>
-Receive the predicted academic performance or risk level for each student.<br>
-Use the predictions to identify at-risk students and implement targeted interventions or support mechanisms.<br>
